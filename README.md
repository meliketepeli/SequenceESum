This code creates an array with the number of values ​​the user enters 
and the sum of the new sub-array to be created from this array is 
requested to be equal to the k value given by the user, it gives 
the index from which the sub-array is created starting from the initial array. 
Since there are two nested loops, the Time Complexity value of the code is O(n²).
